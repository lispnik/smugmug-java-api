Required Libraries
============

All of the libraries in the /lib directory are required for proper operation of the
kallasoft SmugMug Java API with the exception of the following libraries that are either
only needed during build time or runtime during certain operations:

* junit-4.4jar
	This is only required at build and run time to execute the test cases.

* migbase64-2.2.0.jar
	This is only required at run time if you are using the helper methods for the text-based 
	upload method (com.kallasoft.smugmug.api.json.v1_2_0/1.images.Upload) that
	takes a stream as an argument.
	
* commons-io-1.3.2.jar
	This is only required at run time if you are using the helper methods for the binary-based
	upload method (com.kallasoft.smugmug.api.json.v1_2_0/1.images.UploadHTTPPut)
	that takes a stream as an argument.
